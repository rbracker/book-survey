# book-survey

## Introduction
As part of my New Year's resolution for 2024, I set out to read 10 books. So far, I've surpassed that goal and have read 15 books this year! Now, I'm on the hunt for new recommendations to expand my reading list.

The purpose of this book survey is to gather book recommendations from anyone who is willing to take a moment to share their favorite reads. Your suggestions are greatly appreciated, and I can’t wait to explore new stories based on your recommendations!

Thank you in advance for your time and thoughtfulness!
